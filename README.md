# Javascript
My JS Playground


Nothing fancy, just my playground for trying new libraries and code


Minesweeper using p5js: https://bashmohandes.github.io/Javascript/index.html
PONG using p5js: https://bashmohandes.github.io/pong/index.html
Sudoku using p5js: https://bashmohandes.github.io/Sudoku/index.html

It is also a playground for me solving some leetCode problems in JavaScript.
